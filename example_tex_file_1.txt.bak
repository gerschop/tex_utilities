The longitudinal resistivity of the rod can be estimated by using the rule-of-mixture formulas. Based on the known resistivity of the fiber $\rho_{T700}$ and the known fiber volume fraction $\phi$, we can calculate:
\begin{equation}
	\rho_{L,CFRP} = \frac{\rho_{T700SC}}{\phi} = \frac{16\cdot10^{-6} \si{\ohm\meter}}{0.6} = 27 \cdot10^{-6} \si{\ohm\meter}
\end{equation}
This value is very close to the optimal value of $26.7 \cdot10^{-6}$ \si{\ohm\meter} found in the least square optimization and thus suggests that the optimization result is indeed applicable.

The through-thickness resistivity of the material cannot be estimated with a simple equation and is therefore determined by measuring multiple pieces with the dimensions $(8 \times 0.8 \times 20)$ \si{\milli\meter\cubed}. In this experiment, the pieces are cut from pultruded rods from two shipments. The experimental setup used in this experiment is depicted in figure \ref{img:transverse_resistivity_experiment}. The setup is adapted from comparable measurements where two separate electrodes were used in a 4-wire configuration \cite{Wang.2006}. Four separate electrodes for current introduction are painted on both sides of the specimen using silver paint (RS pro silver conductive paint). Between these electrodes, another pair of electrodes is painted for voltage measurement. The voltage electrodes are placed separately from the current electrodes to exclude contact resistance from the measurement. The specimen is then mounted onto a test rig where spring-loaded gold-covered contact pins are pressed onto each of the six surface electrodes. This method produces very similar results ($<$\SI{2}{\percent} difference) to a much more labor-intensive process of attaching individual wires to each electrode, which seems reasonable due to the high conductivity of the silver paint and sufficiently accurate for the purpose of this study. The measurement is performed using the 4-wire method on a Keithley DMM6500 to exclude cable and contact resistance from the measurement. The use of the 4-wire methods results in measured resistances that are \SI{5}{\percent} to \SI{10}{\percent} smaller when compared to 2-wire measurements. 

The results of measurements on seven rods are displayed in figure \ref{img:results_lineplot_resistance_8x08}. For each rod, four different current entry positions are used. Overall, the results show a relatively large scattering between the specimens, with the differences being largest for the measurement at the current introduction. This is plausible because that measurement is not a true 4-wire measurement since both current introduction and potential measurement are performed on the same painted surface. While cable resistances can be excluded from the measurement in this way, the unknown contact resistance between silver paint and the CFRP is still measured. Among others, the contact resistance is likely to be dependent on the electrode thickness and the exact size of the covered area and is thus likely to scatter from one specimen to the next due to the manual specimen preparation. Figure \ref{img:result_10-15_top_bot_fit} shows a model fit of equation \ref{eq:V_x_z_stable} to a single measurement using a least square error approach. In addition to a current input through the top surface, a second measurement is obtained where the current is introduced through contacts located on the bottom surface. Only true 4-wire measurements are used to find both resistivities $\rho_l$ and $\rho_t$. The figure shows a close agreement between model fit and measurement and thus proves the ability of equation \ref{eq:V_x_z_stable} to qualitatively describe the voltage distribution on the top and bottom surface of a specimen. However, are the values calculated by this curve fit quantitatively realistic?
